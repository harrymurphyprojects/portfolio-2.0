      <p className="pt-3 fst-italic lh-lg">I&apos;ve always had an interest in technology, engineering and problem-solving. In sixth-form, I studied engineering then spent 6 years in quarry management whilst also attaining my BSc. I learnt how to manage businesses, people and mining technology. My interest in software engineering started a few years ago when I started listening to the Lex Fridman Podcast; an M.I.T computer scientist who talks about software, AI and future technology. I decided to leave my job in pursuit of a tech career. I took the software engineering course at General Assembly and it was inspirational. It&apos;s opened up a world which I&apos;d like to learn more about. In my first role, I&apos;d like to further my learning in front end and back end applications and become a more competent engineer.
