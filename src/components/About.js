      <p className="pt-3 fst-italic lh-lg">I&apos;ve always had an interest in technology, engineering and problem-solving. In sixth-form, I studied engineering then spent 6 years working quarries whilst part-time studying at university. I learnt how to manage people and technology to extract sand, gravel and rock out of the ground. My interest in software engineering started a few years ago when I started listening to the Lex Fridman Podcast; an M.I.T computer scientist who talks about software, AI and future technology. I decided to leave my job in pursuit of a tech career. I took the software engineering course at General Assembly and it was amazing. I&apos;ve learnt a lot but it&apos;s just opened up an entire world which I&apos;d like to learn about. In my first role, I&apos;d like to further my learning in front end and back end applications and become a more competent engineer.
